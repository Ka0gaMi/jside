# JSIDE

A powerful code editor for web development that works completely offline with PWA support.

## Why

To make it easier for you to compile your code without Linux and similar infrastructure, to compile your code only through the browser, to avoid problems when the internet connection is unstable, to get rid of long installation and configuration processes and for create prototype or production projects without performance problems.

## Fetures

* NPM modules.
* Code compiler & bundler.
* Live preview.
* IntelliSense support.
