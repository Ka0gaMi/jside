# JSIDE

A powerful code editor for web development that works completely offline with PWA support.

## Why

To make it easier for you to compile your code without Linux and similar infrastructure, to compile your code only through the browser, to avoid problems when the internet connection is unstable, to get rid of long installation and configuration processes and for create prototype or production projects without performance problems.

## Features

* Code compiler & bundler.
* IntelliSense (type) support.
* Offline usage.
* Live preview.
* NPM modules.

## Supported Browsers

The 2020-2022 versions of web browsers are enough to keep it running.

### Device File System

To create and edit projects on your device, you will need 2020 versions of Chrome, Opera and Edge.

**Recomendation:** For a better experience, download the PWA version of the page using Chrome, Opera or Edge.

## How to Use

From the **View** menu you can go to **Files**, **Search** and **Projects**.
